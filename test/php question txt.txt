overloading means that a class has more than one method with the same name but different paramters
    class Math
    {
        function sum($unu, $doi) {
        	return $unu + $doi;
        }
        function sum($unu, $doi, $trei) {
	return $unu + $doi + $trei;	        
    }

overriding means that the child class method has the same name and number of arguments with parrent classs but they are doing different things
class Math
    {
        function sum($unu, $doi) {
          
          return $unu + $doi;
        }     
    }
    
    class Math3 extends Math{
      
      function sum($unu, $doi) {
        
        return $unu - $doi;
      }
    }

13. Abstract classes can be used to initialize new objects. They can be used just as extensions for other classes. Interfaces are the same, they are use to specify what methods their classes should use.
18. A design pattern can be module programming: an application is made by modules, for example layered architecture. An application has 3 modules, repository, service and ui. Repository send data to service, service processes data and than send it to ui, and in last ui show it to user. Also this relationship is bidirectionally. User send data to UI(user_interface) and then ui send it to service, service processes data and than sent it to repository.
